# DNS-Changer-Batch-Script

Hi!

This is a script I made myself, it's purpose is to change DNS of your PC's network cards from DHCP to Google's DNS, and vice versa.

This idea started with my habit of changing IPv4's DNS of my Wi-Fi card to Google DNS in order to access blocked websites. I always did this. The problem began when I was at university and couldn't connect to the Wireless Network... Ended up understading that the problem was that I had Google DNS on my PC and should have default/auto mode/DHCP...

Later I saw myself manually changing DNS of network cards to often. Then decided to create a batch script to automatically change Ethernet and Wi-Fi cards for Google DNS and also capable of going back to DHCP.
